## 🤖 What Is Silent Aim in Warframe?

**Silent Aim** is a type of aimbot that **redirects your bullets or projectiles** to hit enemies—**even when your aim isn’t directly on them**. It bypasses visual lock-ons, so your screen stays still while your damage tracks perfectly.

The beauty? It looks 100% legit to other players, teammates, or spectators. There’s no snapping, no hard locks—just quiet precision with every shot.
